# HK Abnormal Stock Track

A stateless, end-of-day (EOD) volume screener for the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX). Each run discovers active HK listings, pulls recent daily data via [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance), and flags stocks whose trading volume shifted significantly versus the **prior trading session**.

No database is required — all data is fetched and processed in memory.

*Run the screener to populate this section with the latest HKEX volume anomalies.*

<!-- DAILY_ALERTS_END -->

## What it detects

A stock is included in the daily alert list when **all** of the following are true:

| Rule | Threshold |
|------|-----------|
| Volume change | ≥ **+20%** or ≤ **−20%** vs prior session |
| Liquidity floor | Latest session volume **> 100,000** shares |
| Valid prior session | Prior session volume > 0 (no divide-by-zero) |

`Pct_Change` is formatted with an explicit sign (e.g. `+83.91%`, `−30.26%`).

## How trading dates work

The screener does **not** use calendar “yesterday.” It inspects the fetched price history and picks the two most recent dates with positive volume across the market:

- **Monday run** → compares Monday vs Friday
- **After a holiday** → skips non-trading days automatically

`Date_Today` and `Date_Prev` in the output refer to those two **trading** sessions, not calendar dates.

Data is fetched with a **5-calendar-day** lookback so weekends and short gaps are covered. Very long market closures (e.g. extended holidays) may yield an empty report if fewer than two sessions appear in the window.

## Output

Each successful run produces:

| Output | Location | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| CSV report | `reports/hk_volume_alerts_YYYYMMDD.csv` | Full alert list |
| Console table | stdout | Markdown-style table |
| GitHub summary | `github_summary.md` | Used by Actions for UI + email |
| README toggle | `README.md` | Collapsible daily alert table on the repo homepage |

### CSV columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Ticker` | Yahoo Finance symbol (e.g. `0700.HK`) |
| `Name` | English name |
| `Name_ZH` | Chinese name |
| `Date_Today` | Latest trading session in the dataset |
| `Date_Prev` | Prior trading session |
| `Volume_Today` | Shares traded on latest session |
| `Volume_Prev` | Shares traded on prior session |
| `Pct_Change` | Signed percent change (e.g. `+83.91%`) |

Reports older than **30 days** are deleted automatically on each run.

## Local setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

A full run screens ~2,800 active HK tickers and typically takes **45–60 minutes** locally, depending on network speed and Yahoo rate limits.

## GitHub Actions automation

The workflow in `.github/workflows/daily_run.yml`:

1. Runs **Monday–Friday at 09:15 UTC** (17:15 HKT) — after the HK close, with time for EOD data to settle
2. Executes `python main.py`
3. Publishes a **GitHub Step Summary** from `github_summary.md`
4. Sends a **daily email** (when configured)
5. Commits updated/deleted files under `reports/` and refreshes the collapsible **Latest alerts** section in `README.md`

You can also trigger a run manually via **Actions → Daily HK Volume Screener → Run workflow**.

### Email secrets

Add these repository secrets under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret | Example |
|--------|---------|
| `SMTP_SERVER` | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_USER` | Your sender email |
| `SMTP_PASS` | App password or SMTP credential |
| `RECEIVER_EMAIL` | Alert recipient |

## Data sources

| Source | Used for |
|--------|----------|
| **Sina Finance** | Active HK ticker list, English + Chinese names |
| **Wikipedia** | Index constituent cross-check |
| **yfinance / Yahoo Finance** | Daily OHLCV history (free, may be delayed) |
| **East Money** | Optional ticker enrichment (best-effort) |

## Design principles

- **Stateless** — no database; each run is independent
- **Holiday-aware dates** — derived from actual volume data, not hardcoded offsets
- **Graceful degradation** — missing tickers, empty batches, and API failures are logged and skipped without crashing the pipeline
- **Free infrastructure** — yfinance + GitHub Actions free tier
